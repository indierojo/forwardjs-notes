## Types For Frontend Developers
Jesse Williamson (?)

## Abstract
It's hard to bring up static types in JavaScript without starting a debate. The benefits of using static types are real, and so are the tradeoffs; the key to figuring out if the benefits outweigh the costs for you & your team. My team recently went through this; I'd like to share some of the lessons we learned, & shed some light on how static types can help your team.

## Notes
 * Looked at typescript, flow, and purescript options, syntax, etc.
