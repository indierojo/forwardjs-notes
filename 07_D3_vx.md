## react + d3 = vx
Harrison Shoff (AirBNB)

## Abstract
A new open source library for building visualizations with react. vx is a library of low-level components that could be used to build a library of reusable charts or that special idea you had for a visualization that youâ€™ve never seen done before.

## Notes
 * Low level react wrapper for d3
 * Very modular
 * also a high-level pre-made chart lib written on top of vx
