## Profiling and Optimizing WebGL Applications Using Google Chrome
Gareth Morgan (?)

## Abstract
In recent years, the WebGL standard has been adopted in a huge range of desktop and mobile web browsers. This is an exciting opportunity for Javascript programmers to develop 3D applications that can be executed directly in the browser. However, it also presents some unique challenges. In particular, optimizing WebGL-based 3D applications, so their performance provides an interactive user experience, is challenging. This talk will discuss these challenges, and the profiling tools and language features available for the Google Chrome web browser that can overcome them.

## In a nutshell
Web GL is very complicated, you can profile it using chrome about://profile
