## The Future of Internet Policy is CATS
Diane Tate (?) and Chris Riley (Mozilla)

## Abstract
Code is Law, said Larry Lessig. But as our speaker likes to add, Law is Law, too. The rules of cyberspace are shaped both by those who write the code and those who have the power to pass laws and rules.

We understand that as citizens, we're obligated to follow the law. Too often though, our politicians aren't nearly as good at following the technology. If they don't get it, they risk harming what makes the internet awesome. And they won't get it unless they learn from developers and all our technologist citizens.

Chris Riley, head of public policy at Mozilla, will discuss how the future of Internet policy is CATS. Yes cats certainly. But also, Competition, Algorithms, Tracking and Security - all complex issues that will be in political debates for years to come, and issues that demand technical translation if governments around the world have any hope of getting the policies right. His Mozilla peer Diane Tate will help him unpack what this means for engineers in this 40-minute interview (with time for Q&A).
