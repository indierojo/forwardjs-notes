## Livable Code
Sarah Mei

## Abstract
None! Here's a recording from EmberConf! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDp6eDCi1Vo

## 'Architecture'
* Idea of development work being 'architecture' is a bit dated
    * Architecture used to be true, and still is on the fringes
    * ... but these days, a lot of what we do is closer to filling out hte details of an existing framework

## No Silver Bullet
* Compared to {Mythical Man Month Author's} article 'No Silver Bullet'
   * No silver bullet says there's no way to get an order of magnitude gain
   * She thinks he was limiting his scope to 'engineering', ala the dated architecture model
   ?? She sort of contests the idea that folks like Bob Martin give that 'with care' you can make a great codebase

## A Better Metaphor?
* Instead, should look at development as occupying / living in a shared space
    * Think many people living in the same house
    * There are all sorts of roommates with varying degress of care and focus and specialties

## Hoarders 
* Compared it to the show 'Hoarders'
   * In Hoarders, she says, the mess doesn't show up, it is the build-up of small things over time, perhaps with good reason from small issues.
   * So it is with our codebases
   * The show went on for 6 seasons, largely with the formula of kick out the hoarder, clean the house, make it nice, move them back in
   * She said the producer of the show stopped it because the above formula doesn't turn out to be effective at curtailing the habit, most of the time, the house ends up in the same state as before.
   * Instead, the best way to fix a hoarding habit is to teach small behaviors with great care over time
   * So it is with our codebases

## So, how do we Fix / Maintain Our Code?
 * She recommends the following 4 steps:
   1. Don't let it get worse
   2. Value Improvement over Consistency
   3. Inline Inline Inline // Fix that shit, don't create a story for tech debt.
   4a. Don't ask permission. (but be upfront)
   4b. Don't ask forgiveness. (but learn from mistakes)
   4c. Do ask for advice. (but don't always take it)
   4d. Do work together. (you've gotta live here)
