## Create Electronic Dance Music with JavaScript
Walmik Deshpande (?)

## Abstract
When you go to a club or a party or a rave.. What is one of the most obvious things you notice about the music?

It's repetitive!

Since we are engineers, what comes first to mind when we see something repeating itself over and over again?

Automate the damn thing \m/

I've created a Node.js module called Scribbletune which has a very minimalistic API (only 3 methods). I'd like to showcase this module along with the options available to us today when it comes to creating music with JavaScript & Node.js right from the terminal. Using my module and regular JavaScript String and Array functions I will put together the structure of a Electronic Dance Music track and show how easy it is for you to start dabbling with EDM using JavaScript

## Notes
 * darn cool, used ScribbleTunes
